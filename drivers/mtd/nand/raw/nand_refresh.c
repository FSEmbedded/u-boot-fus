 * Block Refresh Algorithm for NAND pages with high bitflip counts
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Bitflips may be caused by read disturbs, i.e. after many many reads. Then
 * rewriting the block will help and usually reduces the bit errors back to
 * zero.
 *
 * To refresh the block, we could load it to RAM, erase the block in NAND and
 * then write back the data from RAM to NAND. However if we are interrupted
 * exactly while doing this, for example by a power failure, the data is
 * irretrievably lost. So we'll write the data to a reserved backup block
 * first before we erase the original block. If anything fails, we can resume
 * the refresh procedure at the next start by using the data from the backup
 * block.
 *
 * What's even more, there is a small chance that we do not only have soft
 * bitflips that can be recovered by this refreshing procedure. If we are
 * unlucky, there may also be hard bitflips that remain stuck when erasing or
 * writing back the data to the original block. So instead of a refreshed
 * block we might end up with a bad block after running this procedure. If we
 * keep the data only in RAM, we don't know where to store back the data in
 * this case. But if we use the backup block, we can go to a kind of emergency
 * mode and use the backup block instead of the original block as a
 * replacement. At least until the system is repaired or the original block is
 * "officially" marked bad, in which case we can end the redirection and free
 * the backup block again.
 *
 * So using this backup block provides more data safety, but of course is a
 * little bit more complex.
 *
 * The opportunity to resume an interrupted block refresh depends on the fact
 * that we can detect at boot time if the previous refresh was completely
 * finished or if it was interrupted at some point. This requires to store the
 * offset (or number) of the currently refreshed block in some non-volatile
 * memory as long as the refreshing procedure is in progress. If the page
 * layout of the OOB and ECC data is chosen accordingly, this can be stored in
 * the last page of the backup block itself. For example in the first few bytes
 * of the spare area, where also the bad block marker is stored in the first
 * one or two pages. That is what we'll assume here. But it has to be noted
 * that this approach has some unfortunate side effects. For example step 5 of
 * the following algorithm would not be necessary if the information could be
 * stored somewhere else.
 *
 * This is the basic algorithm:
 *
 *   1. Erase the backup block (just to be sure).
 *   2. Copy data from the original block to the backup block; as the last
 *      step store the refresh offset (e.g. as block number) to the last page.
 *   3. Erase the original block.
 *   4. Copy data from the backup block to the original block.
 *   5. To invalidate the refresh number as quick and atomic as possible,
 *      clear the last page of the backup block by writing 0 to all bytes of
 *      the main and spare area (with a raw write). This should trigger an
 *      uncorrectable ECC error when read before step 6 is finished.
 *   6. Erase the backup block.
 *
 * What happens if power fails during one of these steps?
 *
 *   1. No harm done, the original block is still there and we have no refresh
 *      offset set in the backup block. No resume is done at the next start.
 *   2. No harm done, the original block is still there and we most probably
 *      have no valid refresh offset set in the backup block because we write
 *      it as the last thing in step 2. So no resume is done at the next start.
 *   3. At the next start we'll see the refresh offset in the backup block and
 *      therefore resume the refresh algorithm from step 3.
 *   4. At the next start we'll see the refresh offset in the backup block and
 *      therefore resume the refresh algorithm from step 3. So we'll erase any
 *      partially written data again and write anew.
 *   5. Even if the last page with all zeroes is not completely written back
 *      to the NAND cells, the ECC should fail when reading this page, so the
 *      refresh number is immediately invalidated and we don't do a resume at
 *      the next start. This is important. Without this step it would be
 *      impossible to say if we were interrupted in steps 3 or 4 before the
 *      original block was written back, or in step 6 after the block was
 *      written back but before the backup block was completely erased. In the
 *      latter case it would be fatal to resume a refresh again from step 3,
 *      because we would replace the already correctly written original block
 *      with incomplete data from the partially erased backup block.
 *   6. Even if the backup block is not completely erased yet, we don't have a
 *      valid refresh number anymore due to step 5. So at the next start we'll
 *      ignore the backup block and go to normal mode. No resume is done.
 *
 * Possible error states:
 *
 * NAND_REFRESH_STATE_INSTABLE:
 *       Many bitflips are detected in a page but refresh is not possible.
 *       May happen if backup blocks are all worn down and unusable or
 *       original block is not fully readable in step 2. Data is still OK but
 *       failure is imminent.
 *
 * NAND_REFRESH_STATE_EMERGENCY:
 *       Original block went bad while doing refresh when erasing or restoring
 *       the original block. May happen when flash becomes old and blocks are
 *       worn down and have really stuck bits. The data is still available in
 *       the backup block, therefore reads are redirected to the backup block
 *       (=EMERGENCY MODE). Writes to the block and erasing the block will
 *       fail immediately. No more refreshs are possible because the backup
 *       block is still in use. System is *very* instable, failure is
 *       imminent.
 *       This mode can be cancelled by marking the original block "officially"
 *       as bad, which may happen automatically by the filesystem if any
 *       further modification of this block will fail. Instead of marking the
 *       block bad (which it is already), the backup block is freed again in
 *       this case.
 *
 * NAND_REFRESH_STATE_DATALOSS:
 *       Backup block went bad while doing refresh, before data of original
 *       block could be restored (somewhere between steps 2 and 4). Some data
 *       was actually lost. This is very very unlikely to happen.
 *
 * Remark:
 * The following code uses 0 for invalid offsets. This silently assumes that
 * block 0 (at offset 0) is always required for booting and can neither be
 * refreshed, nor be used as backup block.
